# Simplest Implementation Of `Mongoose`
- [x] ## 1. This is worlds most simplest implementation of `MongoDB` using `Mongoose`!
## 2. The implimentation is so simple that it don't even need a `README` explanation. 
## 3. This repo is made for my future referance. I ususlly get confused by the "cats" and "kitties" in the official website. 
## 4. I have named variables as `ItemSchema` and `ItemModel` insead of `cats` and `kitties`
