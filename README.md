# Simplest Implementation Of `Mongoose`
This is worlds most simplest implementation of `MongoDB` using `Mongoose`!
## The implimentation is so simple that it don't even need a `README` explanation. 


## This repo is made for my future referance. I ususlly get confused by the "cats" and "kitties" in the official website. 

## I have named variables as `ItemSchema` and `ItemModel` insead of `cats` and `kitties`
